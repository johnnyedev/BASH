# Challenge written by https://github.com/jaredwyns

Redirect:
https://YOURDOMAIN/?usless_value=9nasdp0inok112_189%666&magical_herpderp=GjVdvE9gGjVdvE9g&[please_stop!=61%12987

To:
https://google.com with the same args, in reverse order. (stop, magic, value)

Original URL Args:
useless_value magical_herpderp [please_stop!

End Result Args:
[please_stop! magical_herpderp useless_value




1. I want it to redirect only when the magical_herpderp is GjVdvE9gGjVdvE9g and when I get any value for usless_value or [please_stop! with below exceptions.
2. I don't want it to redirect when usless_value is equal to "WhYDoThiS", but I do want it to redirect when it's "whydothis"
3. Also, I want it to redirect over https://, but not over http://.
4. Except when usless_value is "whydothis", it should also redirect over http://.
5. This rule should redirect only on the homepage and on the sub-path ^/jaredwyns/

Another example rule that may help:

if ( $arg_forum_thread_id ) {
rewrite ^ /forum/topic/$arg_forum_thread_id? permanent;
}
